# intern_challenge
A Tic Tac Toe coding challenge for the Gust intership

Implemented in Python


## instructions for running
- Requires Python2
- No dependencies not included within the standard Python2 installation
- clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run the program with `python2 main.py`

## requirements:
- do not include your name or identifying information anywhere in your code
- via some ui - command line, web browser, whatever you like - two players should be able to position x's and o's in turns
- the ui should display the arrangement of x's and o's to the users on a 3x3 grid
- when the grid is full, or one user gets three of their symbols in a row, they should no longer be able to position symbols, and the ui should indicate that the game is over
- there should be some documentation of your program's dependencies, and instructions for getting it up and running
- please do not feel the need to spend more than 2 hours on this project. If you have not completed the requirements after 2 hours, just make a note of that in your documentation. If you feel like you canâ€™t complete the challenge functionally, please submit a description of how you would approach this problem, including pseudocode.

## allowed languages:
- ruby
- javascript (with or without a framework, in the browser w/ html & css or node)
- __python__
- elm
- haskell
- C
- C++
- Java
- some combination thereof

## potential additions: (note, these are not requirements!)
- [ ]cool styles, animations, interactions
- [ ]add an automated test for some part of your implementation
- [x]a single player mode where you can play against an ai that just places its symbol randomly
- [ ]a single player mode where you can play against an ai that places its symbol intelligently

## to submit (3 options):
- write your solution in a fork of this repo, push to github, and send an email to devs@gust.com with a link to the fork
- send devs@gust.com a link to a github/bitbucket/etc. repo for your solution 
- send your (zipped) solution directly to devs@gust.com

**All emails should have the subject line "Intern challenge submission", and the body should include your full name and the link or attachment**
