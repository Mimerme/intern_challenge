# intern_challenge
A coding challenge for our internship applicants

In one of the following languages, please implement a tic-tac-toe game for two users.

requirements:
- via some ui - command line, web browser, whatever you like - two players should be able to position x's and o's in turns
- the ui should display the arrangement of x's and o's to the users on a 3x3 grid
- when the grid is full, or one user gets three of their symbols in a row, they should no longer be able to position sybols, and the ui should indicate that the game is over
- write at least one test. it can be a unit test for some function or module in your implementation, or it can go through the user interface - we don't care.
- there should be some documentation of your program's dependencies, and instructions for getting it up and running
- please do not feel the need to spend more than 2 hours on this project. If you have not completed the requirements after 2 hours, just make a note of that in your documentation

allowed languages:
- ruby
- javascript (with or without a framework, in the browser w/ html & css or node)
- python
- elm
- haskell
- C
- C++
- Java
- some combination thereof

potential additions: (note, these are not requirements!)
- cool styles, animations, interactions
- more comprehensive testing
- a single player mode where you can play against an ai that just places its symbol randomly
- a single player mode where you can play against an ai that places its symbol intelligently
